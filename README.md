# My APP Project
## Description
This is an iOS project based on Objective-C. This project calls the API of https://juhe.cn for news data. 
On the homepage, we display the data in the form of a waterfall. In addition, we can manually set the API Key in the APP, which includes UIAlertView and others.
This project is for learning purposes only, so it is a little rough. I hope you can give me some suggestions to help me improve.
